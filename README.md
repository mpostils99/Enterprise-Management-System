# Enterprise-Management-System
Design, implementation and validation of a database where we add related information about enterprise management using PostgreSQL.

The EMS database is structured in 4 modules. The first one is about sales managment, the second about product manufacturing management, the third about shipping logistics mangement and the last is about human resources management. There's an extra requirement that is a cross-process analyses between de 4 modules.

Concepts developed in this project:
- Design and implement a database for the EMS addressing all requirements.
- Provide documentation that describes the structure of the database, the design decisions, test queries, and user queries.
- Demonstrate the performance of the database by means of comprehensive test cases.
